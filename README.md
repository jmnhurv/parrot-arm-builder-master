# parrot-arm-builder
ParrotSec rootfs arm (armhf at the moment) builder.

You need a Debian (or derivates) or a Parrot (or derivates) installation to use the build system.

(Work in progress to get it working on Ubuntu and derivates)

- You need first to install live-build and some other tools (i386 and x86_64 platforms):

sudo apt-get install live-build qemu-user-static debootstrap make

(If you want to build directly on armhf, remove the references to qemu on the configure script)

And after, cd into armhf and launch a ./configure && make

You can, before launching the build system, modify as you wish, the configure script, the Makefile,
and the hooks and other stuffs, under the customization directory.

The result will be a tarball, into a gzip or a lzma or other formats (you can decide into the configure script),
containing a binary directory, where there is all the rootfs for armhf devices.

All the code is under GPLv3+ .
